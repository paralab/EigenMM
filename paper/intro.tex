Anomalous diffusion is a type of diffusion that has a non-linear relationship with time and has been found to describe certain physical phenomenon better than typical diffusion. {\color{blue} Add examples of anomalous diffusion in nature with citations. } 

Not only is anomalous diffusion interesting as a physical phenomenon, it also has a direct connection to the concept of fractional differential operators in mathematics. Unlike typical differential operators, fractional operators are inherently non-local. This property then has an impact on the type of solvers used for solving problems related to fractional operators. In this paper, we present a framework we have developed for computing approximate solutions to partial different equations that have an anomalous diffusion term. The specific operator that describes anomalous diffusion is known as the Fractional Laplacian and a more detailed discussion can be found in \cite{flaplacian}.
